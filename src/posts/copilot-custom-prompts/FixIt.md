Fix grammar, spelling, typos, and formatting errors in the following text: {}. Preserve all original line breaks, spacing, and special characters exactly as they appear.

Bold: **text** is valid; ** text ** (with spaces) is not bold—fix only if bolding was intended.
Inline code: Use `code` with no spaces inside backticks.
Code blocks: Use triple backticks for multi-line code.
LaTeX math:
Inline: $...$ with no spaces (e.g., $a$, not $ a $,!!!, use $(a,b,c)$ not           $ (a,b,c) $).
Do not add, remove, or restructure any content. Return only the corrected text—no explanations or extra content.
