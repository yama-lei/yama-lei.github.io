### **Scene 1: The Experiment Begins**

#### **[PPT Slide 1]** Title: “The Real or Fake Apple Experiment”

**Narrator (Student 4)** (standing by the side, controlling the PPT):
 “Welcome, everyone! Today, we have an interesting experiment for you. Socrates has brought a ‘mystical apple,’ and each of you will take turns smelling it and telling us what you perceive!”

**(Socrates stands at the front, holding an apple.)**

**Socrates** (mysteriously smiling):
 “My dear students, this is a very special apple. Take turns smelling it and tell me what you sense.”

**(PPT updates: ‘It’s your turn! Smell the apple!’)**

#### **Students Smell the Apple**

-   **Student A** (dramatically smells the apple and excitedly exclaims):
     “Wow! This apple smells amazing! It has such a sweet fragrance!”

*(PPT updates: ‘Student A – "Smells delicious!"’)*

-   **Student B** (takes a deep breath, frowns slightly):
     “Hmm... I don’t really smell anything unusual.”

*(PPT updates: ‘Student B – "No strong scent."’)*

-   **Socrates** (turns to the audience):
     “What do you think? Should an apple have a fragrance? Let’s have a vote!”

*(PPT displays: ‘Does an apple have a smell? Raise your hand!’ Audience votes.)*

### **Scene 2: The Great Plot Twist**

#### **[PPT Slide 2]** “Revealing the Truth – What’s the Answer?”

**Socrates** (smiling mysteriously):
 “My dear students, the truth is… this apple is **FAKE**! It has no smell at all!”

*(PPT shows in bold: “The apple is FAKE?!” Crowd reacts.)*

**Student B** (smugly):
 “I knew it! I was right all along!”

**Narrator (Student 4)** (building suspense):
 “But wait… does this mean Student A was lying?”

*(PPT updates: ‘Was Student A wrong?’)*

**Student A** (firmly, shaking their head):
 “No, no, no! This is a real apple! I smelled the fragrance! I know what I smelled!”

*(Audience likely laughs, expecting an argument.)*

**Socrates** (suddenly smirks, lifts the apple, and takes a big bite):
 “Student A is RIGHT! This **is** a real apple!”

*(PPT instantly switches to: “WHAT?! What’s happening?!” Audience laughs.)*

**Student B** (shocked):
 “What?! But you just said it was fake!”

**Socrates** (chuckles):
 “My dear students, today’s experiment was never about the apple. It was about **perception and belief**. Student A dared to trust their own senses and stand by their truth, while the rest of you were influenced by what others said. That is the real lesson.”

*(PPT switches to: ‘What is the Truth?’)*

------

### **Scene 3: PPT Discussion – Truth vs. Rumors**

#### **[PPT Slide 3]** “Truth in the Real World”

**Narrator (Student 4)** (clicks on PPT, pointing to the screen):
 “We just saw how easily we can be influenced by others. Now, let’s think about real life—how often do we accept something as true just because others say so?”

**(PPT shows a short video: A person at a pizza shop thinks someone stole their pizza, but it turns out they took the wrong one.)**

*(Video plays for 30 seconds, PPT asks: ‘Have you ever misunderstood something like this?’)*

**Socrates** (engaging the audience):
 “Have you ever been in a situation where **everyone** believed something, but you weren’t so sure? How do we know what’s actually true?”

*(PPT Slide 4: ‘Have YOU ever been misled by a rumor?’ Audience raises hands.)*

**Student B** (asking the audience):
 “The internet is full of misinformation. For example, fake celebrity news or false health trends. How do you decide what to believe?”

*(PPT shows headlines of recent fake news and rumors.)*

------

### **Scene 4: Conclusion & Audience Interaction**

#### **[PPT Slide 5]** “Key Takeaway: The Courage to Seek Truth”

**Student C (Narrator)** (delivering the final message):
 “Today’s experiment shows us something important—”

*(PPT updates to: ‘Dare to Trust Your Own Judgment!’)*

**Student C (Narrator)** (asking the audience):
 “What do you think is the best way to recognize truth and avoid being fooled?”

*(PPT presents multiple options for audience discussion:)*

-   “Verify information from multiple sources.”
-   “Think critically—does it make sense?”
-   “Don’t believe everything just because others do.”

*(Audience is encouraged to share their thoughts.)*

**Socrates** (final remarks):
 “The truth is not what people tell you. It’s what **you** discover, analyze, and verify for yourself. I hope this lesson will help you always seek the real truth in life!”

*(PPT displays: ‘THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING!’)*
