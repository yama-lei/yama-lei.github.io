# I/O Stream

Input/Output (I/O) operations in C++ are managed through a set of libraries that provide abstractions for handling streams of data. These libraries allow you to interact with various sources like the console, files, and strings seamlessly.

## `iostream`

The `<iostream>` library provides functionality for reading from and writing to the standard input (`std::cin`) and standard output (`std::cout`). It also includes error streams (`std::cerr` and `std::clog`).

### Key Features:
1. **Standard Input (`std::cin`)**:
   - Reads input from the console.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int number;
     std::cin >> number; // Reads an integer from the user
     ```

2. **Standard Output (`std::cout`)**:
   - Writes output to the console.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
     ```

3. **Error Streams (`std::cerr`, `std::clog`)**:
   - `std::cerr`: Unbuffered, used for immediate error messages.
   - `std::clog`: Buffered, used for logging diagnostic information.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::cerr << "Error: Invalid input!" << std::endl;
     ```

## `fstream`

The `<fstream>` library extends the capabilities of `<iostream>` to handle file-based input and output. It provides classes like `std::ifstream`, `std::ofstream`, and `std::fstream`.

### Key Classes:
1. **`std::ifstream`**:
   - Used for reading data from files.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::ifstream inputFile("data.txt");
     if (!inputFile.is_open()) {
         std::cerr << "Failed to open file!" << std::endl;
     }
     ```

2. **`std::ofstream`**:
   - Used for writing data to files.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::ofstream outputFile("output.txt");
     outputFile << "Writing to file." << std::endl;
     ```

3. **`std::fstream`**:
   - Supports both reading and writing to files.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::fstream file("data.txt", std::ios::in | std::ios::out);
     ```

## `stringstream`

The `<sstream>` library allows you to treat strings as streams, enabling formatted input and output operations on strings.

### Key Classes:
1. **`std::istringstream`**:
   - Used for reading data from strings.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::string data = "42 3.14 Hello";
     std::istringstream iss(data);
     int intValue;
     double doubleValue;
     std::string stringValue;
     iss >> intValue >> doubleValue >> stringValue;
     ```

2. **`std::ostringstream`**:
   - Used for writing data to strings.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::ostringstream oss;
     oss << "Integer: " << 42 << ", Double: " << 3.14;
     std::string result = oss.str();
     ```

3. **`std::stringstream`**:
   - Combines the functionality of `std::istringstream` and `std::ostringstream`.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::stringstream ss;
     ss << "Hello" << " " << "World!";
     std::string message = ss.str();
     ```

# File Operation

File operations involve interacting with files on disk or other storage devices. The typical workflow follows the pattern: **Open -> Perform Operations -> Close**.

## Open and Check

Before performing any file operation, you must ensure the file is successfully opened. This can be done using:

1. **`is_open()`**:
   - Checks if the file stream is open.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::ifstream file("example.txt");
     if (!file.is_open()) {
         std::cerr << "Failed to open file!" << std::endl;
     }
     ```

2. **`try-catch` Block**:
   - Handles exceptions during file operations.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     try {
         std::ifstream file("example.txt");
         if (!file) throw std::runtime_error("File not found!");
     } catch (const std::exception& e) {
         std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
     }
     ```

3. **`assert`**:
   - Ensures the file is open during debugging.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::ifstream file("example.txt");
     assert(file.is_open());
     ```

## File Operation

Once the file is open, you can perform various operations such as reading, writing, appending, and binary file handling.

### Reading from a File
- Use `>>` for formatted input or `getline()` for line-based input.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  std::ifstream file("example.txt");
  std::string line;
  while (std::getline(file, line)) {
      std::cout << line << std::endl;
  }
  ```

### Writing to a File
- Use `<<` for formatted output.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  std::ofstream file("output.txt");
  file << "Writing to file." << std::endl;
  ```

### Appending to a File
- Open the file in append mode (`std::ios::app`).
- Example:
  ```cpp
  std::ofstream file("log.txt", std::ios::app);
  file << "Appending new line." << std::endl;
  ```

### Binary File Handling
- Open the file in binary mode (`std::ios::binary`).
- Example:
  ```cpp
  std::ofstream file("data.bin", std::ios::binary);
  int data = 42;
  file.write(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&data), sizeof(data));
  ```

### Close the File
Closing the file ensures all buffered data is flushed and resources are released.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  file.close();
  ```

# Buffer

A buffer is a temporary storage area used to hold data during input/output operations. Buffers improve performance by reducing direct interactions with slow devices like disks.

## What is Buffer?

Buffers act as intermediaries between programs and external devices. They store data temporarily while it's being read from or written to a device.

### Why Use Buffers?
- Optimize performance by batching I/O operations.
- Reduce the number of expensive system calls.
- Handle partial reads/writes gracefully.

## Common API

1. **Accessing Buffers**:
   
   - Use `rdbuf()` to access the underlying stream buffer.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::ifstream file("example.txt");
     std::streambuf* buf = file.rdbuf();
     ```
   
2. **Flushing Buffers**:
   
   - Use `flush()` to manually flush the buffer.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::cout << "Flushing buffer..." << std::flush;
     ```
   
3. **Customizing Buffers**:
   
   - Use `pubsetbuf()` to set a custom buffer.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     char buffer[1024];
     std::ofstream file("output.txt");
     file.rdbuf()->pubsetbuf(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
     ```
   
4. **Disabling Buffering**:
   
   - Set the buffer size to 0 to disable buffering.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     file.rdbuf()->pubsetbuf(nullptr, 0);
     ```

## Usage in File Operation

Buffers are integral to file operations, especially when dealing with large files or binary data.

### Example: Copying File Content Using Buffers
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
int main() {
    std::ifstream inputFile("source.txt", std::ios::binary);
    std::ofstream outputFile("destination.txt", std::ios::binary);
    if (!inputFile.is_open() || !outputFile.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open files!" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    // Use buffers to copy file content
    outputFile << inputFile.rdbuf();
    inputFile.close();
    outputFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```





>   The buffer of filestream and stringstream are the same.
