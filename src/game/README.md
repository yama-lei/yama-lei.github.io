### ~~Sorry We don't have any game right now, but we'll have some~~ I downloaded some games to make my blog not that boring



<h3> Game1: 2048 (download from github) </h3>
<span>Created by Achilleas Kiritsakas based on 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli. Based on 1024 by Veewo Studio and conceptually similar to Threes by Asher Vollmer.</span>

<h4>Play the game by typing "WASD" which means "up","down","left","right". </h4>
