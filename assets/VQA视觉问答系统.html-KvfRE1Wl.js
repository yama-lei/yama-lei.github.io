General datasets contain many thousands of<br> real-world images from mainstream image datasets like MSCOCO [74] and Imagenet [32]. These datasets are notable for<br> their large scope and diversity. This variety is important as VQA datasets need to reflect the general nature of VQA. Although<br> these datasets do not necessarily capture the endless complexity and variety of visuals in real life, they achieve a close approximation.</p><figure><img src="https://yamapicgo.oss-cn-nanjing.aliyuncs.com/picgoImage/image-20250222220048981.png" alt="image-20250222220048981" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image-20250222220048981</figcaption></figure><h3 id="synthetic-datasets-虚构的" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#synthetic-datasets-虚构的"><span>Synthetic datasets (虚构的)</span></a></h3><p>Synthetic datasets contain artificial images, produced using software, instead of real images.

There are two main ways to predict answers for open-ended VQA:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Non-Generative Approach</strong> (Most Common):</p><ul><li>Treats answers as predefined classes (e.g., all unique answers in the dataset).</li><li>Two types: <ul><li><strong>Single-Label Classification</strong>: The model predicts one answer by outputting a probability distribution (using softmax) over all possible answers, trained to maximize the probability of the most agreed-upon answer from annotators. It’s simple but ignores multiple valid answers.</li><li><strong>Multi-Label Regression</strong>: The model predicts scores for multiple candidate answers, reflecting how many annotators agreed (e.g., VQA-v1 uses a soft score like <code>min(# humans agreeing / 3, 1)</code>). This handles multiple correct answers better. The BUTD model pioneered this by treating it as a regression task, and most modern models follow this approach.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pros</strong>: Easy to implement and evaluate.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: Can’t predict new answers not seen in training.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Generative Approach</strong>:</p><ul><li>Uses an RNN to generate answers word by word.</li><li><strong>Issue</strong>: Hard to evaluate, so it’s rarely used.</li></ul></li></ol><p>For <strong>Multiple-Choice VQA</strong>:</p><ul><li>Treated as a ranking problem: The model scores each question-image-answer trio, and the highest-scoring answer wins.</li></ul><p><strong>Answer Representation</strong>:</p><ul><li>Most models use <strong>one-hot vectors</strong> (e.g., [1, 0, 0] for &quot;dog&quot;) for answers, which is simple but loses semantic meaning—e.g., &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;German Shepherd&quot; are equally wrong compared to &quot;dog.&quot;</li><li>Some newer approaches embed answers into the same semantic space as questions (like word vectors), turning answering into a regression of answer vectors. This makes &quot;German Shepherd&quot; closer to &quot;dog&quot; than &quot;cat,&quot; improving the model’s understanding and training signal.</li></ul><p>In short, modern VQA answering leans toward multi-label regression for open-ended questions, using soft scores from annotators, while multiple-choice uses ranking. Efforts are ongoing to make answer representations more semantically rich!</p><h3 id="mutilmodel-fusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mutilmodel-fusion"><span>Mutilmodel Fusion</span></a></h3><p>In order to perform joint reasoning on a QA pair, information from the two modalities have to mix and interact. This can be achieved by multimodal fusion. We divide fusion in VQA into two types, <strong>vector operation</strong> and <strong>bilinear pooling</strong>.</p><h4 id="vector-operation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vector-operation"><span>Vector operation</span></a></h4><p>In vector addition and multiplication, question and image features are projected linearly through fully-connected layers to match their dimensions.</p><blockquote><p>Namely: fusion the vector of image and question by vector operation</p></blockquote><ul><li>cons: Bad Accuarcy</li></ul><h4 id="bilinear-pooling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bilinear-pooling"><span>Bilinear pooling</span></a></h4><blockquote><p>The following content is generated by Grok3 for the raw survey is too hard for me. ಥ_ಥ</p></blockquote><p><strong>Bilinear Pooling</strong> combines question and image feature vectors (e.g., both 2048-dimensional) by computing their <strong>outer product</strong>, capturing all interactions between them. For an output ( &lt;z_i ) (answer score), it’s defined as ( z_i = x^T W_i y ), where ( x ) is the question vector, ( y ) is the image vector, and ( W ) is a huge weight tensor. However, with 3000 answer classes, this requires billions of parameters (e.g., 12.5 billion), making it computationally expensive and prone to overfitting. Different models tweak this to balance complexity and performance:</p><blockquote><ol><li><p><strong>MCB (Multimodal Compact Bilinear)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Uses a trick from math: the outer product’s &quot;count sketch&quot; can be computed as a convolution of individual sketches.</li><li>Replaces convolution with an efficient element-wise product in FFT space to indirectly get the outer product.</li><li>Still has many parameters due to fixed random settings.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>MLB (Multimodal Low-rank Bilinear)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Reduces parameters by decomposing ( W = U V^T ), turning ( z_i = 1^T (U_i^T x \\circ V_i^T y) ) (where ( \\circ ) is element-wise multiplication).</li><li>Limits ( W )’s rank to ( k ), cutting complexity, and adds a matrix ( P_i ) for further reduction.</li><li>Downside: Slow to train and sensitive to tuning.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>MFB (Multimodal Factorized Bilinear)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Tweaks MLB by adjusting ( U ) and ( V ) dimensions and adding <strong>sum pooling</strong> over windows of size ( k ): ( z = SumPool(U&#39;^T x \\circ V&#39;^T y, k) ).</li><li>MLB is a special case when ( k = 1 ). <strong>MFH</strong> stacks MFBs for richer pooling.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>MUTAN (Multimodal Tucker Fusion)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Uses <strong>Tucker decomposition</strong>: ( W = \\tau_c \\times W_q \\times W_v \\times W_o ).</li><li>( W_q ) and ( W_v ) project question and image vectors, ( \\tau_c ) controls interaction complexity, and ( W_o ) scores answers.</li><li>MCB and MLB are simpler versions of this.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>BLOCK</strong>:</p><ul><li>Uses <strong>block-term decomposition</strong>, balancing MLB (many small blocks, high-dimensional but weak interactions) and MUTAN (one big block, strong interactions but less accurate projections).</li><li>Strikes a middle ground and often performs better.</li></ul></li></ol></blockquote><p>In short, bilinear pooling fuses question and image data via their outer product, but raw computation is impractical. These models (MCB, MLB, MFB, MUTAN, BLOCK) reduce parameters in clever ways, trading off expressiveness (how much they capture) and trainability (how easy they are to optimize). Each improves on the last, with BLOCK aiming for the best of both worlds!</p><h3 id="attention" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attention"><span>Attention</span></a></h3><p>Make the model to focus on the object that are more relavant to <strong>questions</strong> to filter out noise and imrove accuarcy.</p><h4 id="soft-and-hard-attention" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#soft-and-hard-attention"><span>Soft and hard attention</span></a></h4><p>Both of <strong>soft attention</strong> and <strong>hard attention</strong> use the question to make a map, which assigns the objects on the picture to different values--the more relavent, the higher the value is.</p><p>But the difference lies in:</p><ul><li><strong>Soft attention</strong> assigns all the object to a cretain value, do not dismiss any objects;</li><li><strong>Hard attention</strong> discard those with low relavance, and only cares about those relavent to the questions</li></ul><h4 id="grid-and-objct-based-attention" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#grid-and-objct-based-attention"><span>Grid and objct based attention</span></a></h4><h4 id="bottom-up-and-top-down-attention" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bottom-up-and-top-down-attention"><span>BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN ATTENTION</span></a></h4><h4 id="co-attention-and-self-attention" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#co-attention-and-self-attention"><span>CO-ATTENTION AND SELF-ATTENTION</span></a></h4><blockquote><p>To get more about these attention machenism, read the raw paper.</p></blockquote><h3 id="external-knowledge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#external-knowledge"><span>External Knowledge</span></a></h3><p>Sometimes the model need more information to solve the problem,int that case, we need to give the model the capability to query an <strong>External Knowledge Base</strong> or <strong>EKB</strong>.</p><hr>',71)]))}const g=t(r,[["render",l],["__file","VQA视觉问答系统.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/%E7%A7%91%E7%A0%94%E5%90%AF%E8%92%99/VQA%E8%A7%86%E8%A7%89%E9%97%AE%E7%AD%94%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F.html","title":"VQA视觉问答系统学习笔记","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"VQA视觉问答系统学习笔记","date":"2025-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VQA 综述阅读： This passage is a reading note of a survey on VQA.
